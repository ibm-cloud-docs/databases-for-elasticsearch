# {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch_full}} Enterprise Plan
{: #elastic-enterprise}

Our strategic partnership with [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/about/){: external} since January 2023 means that we are able to offer more and richer functionality, as well as world-class levels of support.

All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} plans deploy as one highly available Elasticsearch cluster with three data members. Your data is replicated across members. Plans are priced based on the total amount of disk storage, RAM, dedicated cores, and backup storage that is allocated to deployments, prorated hourly. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} deployments have a minimum of 5 GB of disk and 1 GB of RAM per data member.

Version 7.17 is the current supported version of {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} and is offered under our Enterprise Plan. This version includes functionality that is not available in our Standard plan. These were features that were previously offered by Elastic as paid-for add-ons under the X-Pack label, such as [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/es-security-principles.html#security-create-appropriate-users){: external} and [Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/index-lifecycle-management.html){: external}.
Once deployed, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} clusters make full use of other Elastic Stack components such as [Kibana](/docs/databases-for-elasticsearch?topic=databases-for-elasticsearch-getting-started#kibana), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/){: external}, and [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/){: external}.
