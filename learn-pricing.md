# Pricing
{: #pricing}

Our strategic partnership with [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/about/){: external} since January 2023 means that we are able to offer more and richer functionality, as well as world-class levels of support.

All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} plans provision as one highly available Elasticsearch cluster with three data members located in three different zones. Your data is replicated across members. Plans are priced based on the total amount of disk storage, RAM, dedicated cores, and backup storage that is allocated to instances, prorated hourly. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} instances have a minimum of 5 GB of disk and 1 GB of RAM per data member.

## {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch_full}} Enterprise Plan
{: #elastic-enterprise-pricing}

The {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} Enterprise Plan provisions the Basic version of Elasticsearch. This plan offers features that were previously offered by Elastic as paid-for add-ons under the X-Pack label, such as [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/es-security-principles.html#security-create-appropriate-users){: external} and [Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/index-lifecycle-management.html){: external}.

Once provisioned, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} Enterprise Plan clusters make full use of other Elastic Stack components such as [Kibana](/docs/databases-for-elasticsearch?topic=databases-for-elasticsearch-getting-started#kibana), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/){: external}, and [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/){: external}.

## {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch_full}} Platinum Plan
{: #elastic-platinum-pricing}

The {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} Platinum Plan provisions the Platinum version of Elasticsearch. This plan offers all the features of our Enterprise Plan, plus premium features like the ability to run [machine learning](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/machine-learning){: external} workloads, including Elastic's own [Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html){: external} for semantic search.
Our Platinum Plan also includes enhanced security features, like document- and [field-level security](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/field-level-security.html){: external}. See a full comparison of Enterprise and Platinum plans at [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} Plans](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-elasticsearch?topic=databases-for-elasticsearch-elastic-offerings).

## Using the Pricing Calculator
{: #pricing-calc}

Prices for the different plans reflect different levels of available functionality. Templates are provided for ease of use and provide balanced resource allocations appropriate for general-purpose workloads. The **Custom** tab can be used to configure Disk, RAM, and vCPU, as wanted.
For pricing estimation, use the **Add to Estimate** button on the [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/databases/databases-for-elasticsearch/create). Input your total consumption across three data members into the calculator. For example, 5 GB of disk and 1 GB of RAM across three data members would be priced at 15 GB of disk and 3 GB of RAM.

## Dedicated Cores Pricing
{: #pricing-cores}

You have the option of selecting the CPU allocation for your instance. With dedicated cores, your resource group is given a single-tenant host with a guaranteed minimum reserve of cpu shares. Your instances are then allocated the number of CPUs you specify. The cost of dedicated cores is $30 per core per month, and each member gets the selected number of cores. For example, if you provision an instance with 3 dedicated cores per member, that is a total of 9 cores and is billed at $270 per month. 

Dedicated cores are an optional feature. The default `Shared CPU` setting provisions your instance on hosts with shared compute resources and incurs no additional charge.

## Backups Pricing
{: #pricing-backup}

You receive your total disk space purchased, per database, in free backup storage. For example, in a given month, if your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} instance has 20 GB of disk per member and three data members, you receive 60 GB of backup storage free for that month. If your backup storage utilization is greater than 60 GB for the month (in this scenario), you are charged an overage of $0.03/month per gigabyte.Â 

By default, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} provides a daily backup that is stored for 30 days. These backups, and any on-demand backups you make, all count toward the above allocation.

In the above example, if your database contains 2 GB of data and you have not taken any on-demand backups, then your total backup size is 2 GB x 30 = 60 GB. Your backup costs are nil.

If your database contains 15 GB of data and you have not taken any on-demand backups, then your total backup size is 15 GB x 30 = 450 GB. In this scenario, your backup costs are (450 GB - 60 GB) * 0.03 = $11.7 per month.

Most instances will not ever go over the allotted credit.

## Scaling per Member
{: #pricing-member}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-elasticsearch}} instances have minimum and maximum allocation for disk and RAM as shown. Scaling instances through the API/CLI provides more granularity and also allows a user to scale a database instance up to 4 TB of disk per member.

| Resource | Minimum | Maximum | Scaling Granularity (API/CLI) |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Disk | 5 GB per member | 4 TB per member | 1024 MB per member |
| RAM | 1 GB per member | 112 GB per member | 128 MB per member |
| CPU (if enabled) | 3 CPUs per member | 28 CPUs per member| 1 CPU per member |
